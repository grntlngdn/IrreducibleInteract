# IrreducibleInteract
Converting elements of problem 4 of my SageMath project into Java as review of Java

This demonstrates the notion of non-unique factorizations into irreducibles. For instance, consider the integers divisible by 4 such as -8, -4, 0, 4, and 8 (this can be labeled 4Z). In 4Z, the number 144 can be factored into 12*12 or 4*36 and each of these factors are irreducible in 4Z (in other words any factorization of an element like 36 would contain an element not in 4z). As another example in 4Z, 64 can be factored into 8*8 or 4*4*4.
